   * For scenarios in which links returned by the service are used by the client to poll for additional information, the
   * client can specify the odata.callback preference to request that the service notify the client when data is
   * available.
   * <br />
   * The odata.callback preference can be specified:
   * <ul>
   * <li>when requesting asynchronous processing of a request with the respond-async preference, or</li>
   * <li>on a GET request to a delta link.</li>
   * </ul>
   * <br />
   * The odata.callback preference MUST include the parameter url whose value is the URL of a callback endpoint to be
   * invoked by the OData service when data is available. The syntax of the odata.callback preference is specified in
   * [OData-ABNF]. For HTTP based callbacks, the OData service executes an HTTP GET request against the specified URL.
   * <br />
   * Services that support odata.callback SHOULD support notifying the client through HTTP. Services can advertise
   * callback support using the Capabilities.CallbackSupport annotation term defined in [OData-VocCap].
   * <br />
   * If the service applies the odata.callback preference it MUST include the odata.callback preference in the
   * Preference-Applied response header.
   * <br />
   * When the odata.callback preference is applied to asynchronous requests, the OData service invokes the callback
   * endpoint once it has finished processing the request. The status monitor resource, returned in the Location header
   * of the previously returned 202 Accepted response, can then be used to retrieve the results of the asynchronously
   * executed request.
   * <br />
   * When the odata.callback preference is specified on a GET request to a delta link and there are no changes
   * available, the OData service returns a 202 Accepted response with a Location header specifying the delta link to be
   * used to check for future updates. The OData service then invokes the specified callback endpoint once new changes
   * become available.
   * <br />
   * Combining respond-async, odata.callback and odata.track-changes preferences on a GET request to a delta-link might
   * influence the response in a couple of ways.
   * <ul>
   * <li>If the service processes the request synchronously, and no updates are available, then the response is the same
   * as if the respond-async hadnâ€™t been specified and results in a response as described above.</li>
   * <li>If the service processes the request asynchronously, then it responds with a 202 Accepted response specifying
   * the URL to the status monitor resource as it would have with any other asynchronous request. Once the service has
   * finished processing the asynchronous request to the delta link resource, if changes are available it invokes the
   * specified callback endpoint. If no changes are available, the service SHOULD wait to notify the client until
   * changes are available. Once notified, the client uses the status monitor resource from the Location header of the
   * previously returned 202 Accepted response to retrieve the results. In case no updates were available after
   * processing the initial request, the result will contain no updates and the client can use the delta-link contained
   * in the result to retrieve the updates that have since become available.</li>
   * </ul>
   * <br />
   * If the consumer specifies the same URL as callback endpoint in multiple requests, the service MAY collate them into
   * a single notification once additional data is available for any of the requests. However, the consumer MUST be
   * prepared to deal with receiving up to as many notifications as it requested.
   * <br /><br />
   * Example: using a HTTP callback endpoint to receive notification
   * <br /><br />
   * Prefer: odata.callback; url="http://myserver/notfication/token/12345"
